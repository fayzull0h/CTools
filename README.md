# C/C++Tools

The following .c/.cpp files are programs, tools and experiments I've made using C/C++.

In the "binaries" folder, the compiled versions of the programs for macOS are present. 
Just download the file you want from there to your desktop and double-click on it to run it.

#### Extended Euclidean Algorithm
The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is a way to find the greatest common divisor between two integers (a, b) and find two integers (x, y) such that ax + by = gcd(a, b).
In the math135 directory, you can find the source code for my implementation of it under eea.c.
There is also a binary file for macOS systems in the binaries directory.
